# GitHub Copilot Workflow Integration

## Overview

The **GitHub Copilot Code Review and Quality Analysis** workflow provides comprehensive automated code analysis for every pull request and push to the main repository. This workflow enhances the development process by providing AI-powered insights, security analysis, and quality checks.

## Features

### 🔍 **Code Quality Analysis**
- TypeScript compilation verification
- ESLint linting with automated suggestions
- Code complexity analysis (file size, structure)
- Test execution and coverage reporting

### 🔐 **Security Analysis**
- NPM dependency vulnerability scanning
- Encryption implementation review
- Hardcoded secret detection
- Weak cryptographic algorithm identification

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Code Review**
- Automated pull request comments
- Context-aware suggestions
- Project-specific recommendations
- Integration with GitHub's review system

### 📊 **Performance Analysis**
- Bundle size monitoring
- Dependency analysis and conflict detection
- Large file detection and warnings

## Workflow Triggers

The Copilot workflow runs automatically on:

1. **Pull Requests**: When opened, synchronized, or reopened against main/develop branches
2. **Push Events**: Direct pushes to main/develop branches
3. **Manual Trigger**: Workflow dispatch with optional deep analysis mode

### Smart Filtering

The workflow intelligently skips analysis for:
- Version bump commits (from auto-version-bump workflow)
- Release commits
- Non-code changes (when appropriate)

## Integration with Existing Workflows

The Copilot workflow is designed to complement existing CI/CD processes:

- **Does not interfere** with `auto-version-bump.yml`
- **Does not interfere** with `release-with-sbom.yml`
- **Runs in parallel** with other quality checks
- **Provides additional insights** without blocking releases

## Usage Examples

### For Pull Requests

When you create a pull request, the workflow will:

1. Analyze changed files automatically
2. Run appropriate checks based on file types
3. Generate an AI-powered review comment
4. Upload detailed analysis artifacts

Example PR comment generated:

```markdown
## 🤖 AI-Powered Code Review Summary

### 🔍 Code Quality Analysis Results
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
⚠️ Linting issues detected
✅ All tests passing

### 🔐 Security Analysis Report
✅ No security issues detected in static analysis
⚠️ 3 vulnerabilities found in dependencies

### 💡 AI Recommendations
- Consider adding type definitions for better type safety
- Ensure proper error handling for async operations
- For encryption features: Ensure proper key management
```

### Manual Analysis

For deep analysis of specific branches:

```bash
# Trigger via GitHub UI or API
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/anoncam/dedpaste/actions/workflows/copilot-review.yml/dispatches \
  -d '{"ref":"main","inputs":{"deep_analysis":"true"}}'
```

## Local Testing

You can simulate the workflow locally using the test script:

```bash
# Run from repository root
./.github/workflows/test-copilot-workflow.sh
```

This provides a preview of what the workflow will analyze and report.

## Workflow Configuration

### Environment Variables

The workflow uses these GitHub secrets (automatically available):
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: For API access and artifact uploads

### Permissions

The workflow requires these permissions:
- `contents: read` - Access repository files
- `pull-requests: write` - Comment on PRs
- `security-events: write` - Security analysis reporting
- `actions: read` - Workflow metadata access
- `checks: write` - Check status updates

## Artifacts Generated

Each workflow run creates downloadable artifacts:

- **code-quality-analysis**: Compilation logs, lint results, test output
- **security-analysis**: NPM audit results, security scan reports
- **performance-analysis**: Bundle size reports, dependency analysis

Artifacts are retained for 7 days and can be downloaded from the Actions tab.

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Review AI suggestions carefully** - Automated suggestions are helpful but should be validated
2. **Address security warnings** - Pay attention to security analysis results
3. **Monitor complexity metrics** - Large files may need refactoring
4. **Check bundle size changes** - Ensure performance impact is acceptable

### For Maintainers

1. **Configure branch protection** - Require Copilot checks for protected branches
2. **Review workflow logs** - Monitor for recurring issues
3. **Update security patterns** - Customize security analysis as needed
4. **Manage artifact retention** - Adjust retention based on storage needs

## Customization

### Adding Custom Checks

To add project-specific analysis:

```yaml
# In copilot-review.yml, add to code-quality job
- name: Custom Analysis
  run: |
    echo "Running custom checks..."
    # Your custom analysis here
```

### Modifying AI Recommendations

Update the recommendation logic in the `copilot-review` job:

```yaml
- name: Generate AI review summary
  run: |
    # Add your custom recommendation logic
    echo "- Custom recommendation for this project" >> copilot-review.md
```

### Security Pattern Customization

Modify security detection patterns in the `security-analysis` job to match your project's needs.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Workflow not triggering:**
- Check branch protection settings
- Verify workflow file syntax with YAML validation
- Ensure proper permissions are configured

**Build failures:**
- Check TypeScript compilation errors in artifacts
- Verify all dependencies are properly installed
- Review error logs in workflow run details

**Missing artifacts:**
- Ensure jobs completed successfully
- Check artifact upload steps for errors
- Verify artifact retention settings

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting workflow inputs:

```yaml
inputs:
  deep_analysis: true  # Enables comprehensive analysis
```

## Support

For issues with the Copilot workflow:

1. Check the [workflow logs](https://github.com/anoncam/dedpaste/actions/workflows/copilot-review.yml)
2. Review the [README.md](.github/workflows/README.md) for detailed configuration
3. Test locally using the simulation script
4. Create an issue with workflow run details if problems persist

## Contributing

To improve the Copilot workflow:

1. Test changes using the simulation script
2. Validate YAML syntax before committing
3. Update documentation for new features
4. Ensure backward compatibility with existing workflows
