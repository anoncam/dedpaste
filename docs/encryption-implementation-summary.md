# Encryption Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of end-to-end encryption in DedPaste according to the plan outlined in `encryption-implementation-plan.md`.

## Completed Implementation

### 1. Server-Side Changes (src/index.ts)

- Added support for the `/e/{id}` path for encrypted pastes
- Added endpoints for encrypted uploads (`/e/upload` and `/e/temp`)
- Updated URL generation to include the `/e/` prefix for encrypted pastes
- Added a header to indicate if a paste is encrypted (`X-Encrypted`)
- Updated the HTML homepage with documentation for encryption features

### 2. CLI-Side Changes (cli/index.js)

- Added encryption options to the CLI (`--encrypt`, `--key-file`, `--gen-key`)
- Implemented key management functions:
  - Key generation
  - Loading keys from files
  - Improved handling of key formats with clear user guidance
- Implemented encryption using a hybrid approach:
  - RSA for key exchange
  - AES-256-GCM for content encryption
- Implemented decryption functionality with proper key handling

### 3. Documentation Updates

- Updated README.md with information about encryption features
- Added examples of using encryption in the CLI
- Added a detailed section about how the encryption works
- Updated security considerations

### 4. Testing

- Created unit tests for encryption/decryption functionality
- Added security tests to verify encryption properties
- Updated package.json with test dependencies and script

## Security Properties

The implemented encryption solution provides:

1. **End-to-End Encryption**: All encryption/decryption happens client-side
2. **Zero Knowledge**: The server never sees unencrypted content or keys
3. **Forward Secrecy**: Each paste uses a different symmetric key
4. **Strong Encryption**: Uses industry-standard AES-256-GCM
5. **Key Security**: Private keys never leave the user's device

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Encrypted Paste

```bash
# Using generated keys (recommended)
$ echo "secret data" | dedpaste --encrypt --gen-key

‚úì Generated new key pair:
  - Private key: ~/.dedpaste/keys/private.pem
  - Public key: ~/.dedpaste/keys/public.pem

‚úì Paste created successfully!
‚ö†Ô∏è This paste is encrypted and can only be decrypted with your private key

üìã https://paste.d3d.dev/e/AbCdEfGh

# Using existing PEM format key
$ echo "secret data" | dedpaste --encrypt --key-file ~/my-keys/public.pem

‚úì Paste created successfully!
‚ö†Ô∏è This paste is encrypted and can only be decrypted with your private key

üìã https://paste.d3d.dev/e/AbCdEfGh

# Note: Standard SSH keys are not directly supported
# The CLI will offer to generate compatible keys if an SSH key is detected
```

### Accessing an Encrypted Paste

```bash
$ dedpaste get https://paste.d3d.dev/e/AbCdEfGh

‚ö†Ô∏è This paste is encrypted
Enter path to private key [~/.dedpaste/keys/private.pem]: 

‚úì Paste decrypted successfully:
secret data
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the encryption implementation:

1. Add support for password-protected private keys
2. Implement key rotation functionality
3. Add support for sharing encrypted pastes with multiple recipients
4. Create a web interface for encryption/decryption
5. Add support for additional encryption algorithms

## Conclusion

The encryption implementation successfully meets all the requirements outlined in the original plan. It provides a secure, end-to-end encrypted solution for sharing sensitive content through DedPaste, with all encryption and decryption happening client-side.
